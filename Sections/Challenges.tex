\section{Challenges}\\\\\\
There an many challenges regarding variable pitch control on quadcopters. Few has done this before, and there is not much documentation to read, compared to fixed pitch quadcopters. many trade-offs must be considered when we are choosing variable pitch design. We have investigated existing designs, and the most common design is to have one central motor which drives all four propellers, using shafts and gearing to the propellers. The pros of this design is that it is energy efficient, and all propellers have the same RPM at the same time. having the same RPM on all motors makes the control system, much easier to design.\\ \\ Having variable 






    - Building flight controller
    - Vibrations
    - Central motor drift
    -Individual motor drift
    -Variable pitch mechanism
        -Few mechanisms on the marked
        - Of the shellf china shit mechanism
        -RC helicopter tail mechanisms
            - Heli tails has central motor with shaft
            - Must modify the mechanism
            - Maybe "dreie" shaft and add
            -Or use a "Hylse" with screws to put them together
